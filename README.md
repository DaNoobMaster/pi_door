#Pi_Door
Ths project is a smart door lock created using a raspberry pi zero 2w. This is the cheapest raspberry pi capable of running what i want this project needs.
The door is capable of Face ID, Palm vein recognition, fingerprint and has a 4x4 keypad entry as well. QR codes can be generated for one time use to open the door as well.
It uses high-end secure biometric components in order to keep it reliable and safe. There is a live camera feed as well that would be transmitted from the camera to the local raspberry pi server.

The aim of this project is to make entering my house quicker and more reliable. Due to the fact that its mostly digital, it is less susceptible to intruder attacks and can help catch intruders if an attack does occur. The live camera feed is also helpful in checking who is at your at door. I belive this project would use my skills to the most. Its mechanical and software aspect is perfect for me to improve my skills and learn how to work with such types of hardware.
